A. Critical Alerts (Red Warning)
These ingredients are commonly associated with severe allergic reactions or major intolerances/sensitivities that necessitate strict avoidance.
Milk (Lactose, Casein, Whey): Common dairy allergen; can cause digestive issues or severe allergic reactions.
Eggs: Common allergen; found in many baked goods, sauces.
Peanuts: Legume allergen; can cause severe, life-threatening reactions.
Tree Nuts (Almonds, Walnuts, Cashews, Pecans, Hazelnuts, Pistachios): Group of allergens; can cause severe, life-threatening reactions.
Soy (Soybean, Soy Lecithin): Common legume allergen; found in many processed foods.
Wheat (Gluten): Cereal grain allergen; contains gluten which affects those with Celiac disease or sensitivities.
Fish (any fin fish): Seafood allergen; can cause allergic reactions.
Shellfish (Crab, Shrimp, Lobster, Mussels, Oysters, Clams): Crustacean and mollusk allergen; can cause severe allergic reactions.
Sesame: Seed allergen; can cause allergic reactions.
Mustard: Spice allergen; can cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.
Celery: Vegetable allergen; used in soups, broths, and seasonings.
Sulfite/Sulfites (E220-E228): Preservatives; can cause respiratory issues or allergic reactions in sensitive individuals (especially asthmatics).
Lupin: Legume related to peanuts; can cause allergic reactions.
B. Caution Alerts (Yellow/Orange Warning)
These additives are commonly included in processed foods and while generally not allergens causing acute reactions, they are often a concern for individuals with sensitivities, certain health conditions, or those following a "clean eating" philosophy due to perceived health risks or processing.
Preservatives:
Potassium Sorbate (E202): Mold and yeast inhibitor; extends shelf life.
Sodium Benzoate (E211): Antifungal preservative; common in acidic foods and drinks; can form benzene in presence of Vitamin C.
Calcium Propionate (E282): Mold inhibitor; often used in baked goods.
BHA (E320): Antioxidant preservative; prevents fats from going rancid; some health concerns.
BHT (E321): Antioxidant preservative; prevents fats from going rancid; some health concerns.
Nitrates/Nitrites (E249-E252): Preservatives; used to cure meats and prevent bacterial growth; potential formation of nitrosamines.
Colorings:
Caramel Color (E150a-d): Food coloring; used to impart brown shades; some types (like E150c/d) linked to 4-MeI concern.
Annatto (E160b): Natural yellow-orange food coloring; some individuals can be sensitive.
Turmeric (E100): Natural yellow spice extract and coloring; generally safe, but listed as an additive.
Titanium Dioxide (E171): White food coloring; provides brightness and opacity; microparticle concerns debated.
Red 40 (E129): Artificial red food coloring; commonly linked to hyperactivity in children.
Yellow 5 (E102): Artificial yellow food coloring; commonly linked to hyperactivity in children.
Yellow 6 (E110): Artificial orange-yellow food coloring; commonly linked to hyperactivity in children.
Blue 1 (E133): Artificial blue food coloring.
Emulsifiers/Stabilizers/Thickeners:
Lecithin (E322): Emulsifier; helps oil and water mix; sometimes sourced from soy or sunflower.
Mono- and Diglycerides (E471): Emulsifiers; improves texture and prevents separation; often derived from animal fats (concern for vegans/vegetarians).
Xanthan Gum (E415): Thickener and stabilizer; can cause digestive upset in sensitive individuals.
Guar Gum (E412): Thickener and stabilizer; natural fiber, can cause digestive upset.
Carrageenan (E407): Thickener and gelling agent; derived from seaweed; controversial for potential inflammation/GI issues.
Pectin (E440): Natural gelling agent; common in jams and jellies.
Polysorbate 80 (E433): Emulsifier and solubilizer; some studies suggest impact on gut microbiome.
Sweeteners (Artificial/High-Intensity):
Aspartame (E951): Artificial sweetener; metabolic concerns for some; contains phenylalanine.
Sucralose (E955): Artificial sweetener; some studies suggest gut health impacts.
Saccharin (E954): Artificial sweetener; one of the oldest synthetic sweeteners.
Acesulfame Potassium (E950): Artificial sweetener; often combined with other sweeteners.
Flavor Enhancers:
Monosodium Glutamate (MSG, E621): Flavor enhancer; provides umami taste; known sensitivities ("MSG symptom complex").
Disodium Guanylate (E626-E629): Flavor enhancer; often used with MSG.
Disodium Inosinate (E630-E633): Flavor enhancer; often used with MSG.
Anti-caking Agents:
Silicon Dioxide (E551): Anti-caking agent; prevents clumping of powdered ingredients; concerns about nanoparticles.
Calcium Carbonate (E170): Anti-caking agent; also a food whitener and firming agent.
