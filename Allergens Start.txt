A. Critical Alerts (Red Warning)
These are allergens or substances that can cause serious, life-threatening allergic reactions, or medically recognized severe intolerances.
Milk (Lactose, Casein, Whey): "Critical allergen: Can trigger severe allergic reactions (e.g., hives, swelling, breathing issues) or digestive distress (e.g., bloating, diarrhea) for those with lactose intolerance."
Eggs: "Critical allergen: May cause allergic reactions from mild (e.g., hives, stomach upset) to severe (e.g., breathing difficulty, anaphylaxis)."
Peanuts: "Critical allergen: High risk for severe, life-threatening allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Strict avoidance is crucial."
Tree Nuts (Almonds, Walnuts, Cashews, Pecans, Hazelnuts, Pistachios): "Critical allergen group: Can cause severe allergic reactions (e.g., swelling, breathing issues, anaphylaxis). Avoid if allergic to any tree nut."
Soy (Soybean, Soy Lecithin): "Critical allergen: May cause allergic reactions, ranging from mild skin/digestive issues to more severe systemic reactions."
Wheat (Gluten): "Critical allergen: Contains gluten; triggers severe autoimmune reaction in Celiac disease, or digestive/other symptoms in non-celiac gluten sensitivity."
Fish (any fin fish): "Critical allergen: Can cause allergic reactions, from hives and swelling to severe anaphylaxis."
Shellfish (Crab, Shrimp, Lobster, Mussels, Oysters, Clams): "Critical allergen: Common cause of severe, sometimes life-threatening allergic reactions (e.g., rapid swelling, breathing issues)."
Sesame: "Critical allergen: A growing common allergen that can cause mild to severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis."
Mustard: "Critical allergen: Can cause allergic reactions, usually mild skin or digestive symptoms, but severe reactions are possible in highly sensitive individuals."
Celery: "Critical allergen: May cause allergic reactions, sometimes including oral allergy syndrome, skin rashes, or digestive issues."
Sulfites (E220-E228): "Critical sensitivity: Can trigger asthma symptoms (e.g., wheezing, shortness of breath) in sensitive individuals, or other allergic-like reactions."
Lupin: "Critical allergen: As a legume, it can cause allergic reactions, especially in those with peanut or soy allergies."
B. Caution Alerts (Yellow/Orange Warning)
These ingredients are often associated with concerns about general health, potential mild sensitivities, dietary restrictions, or are frequently avoided as a personal choice.
Preservatives:
Potassium Sorbate (E202): "Caution: Generally safe, but rarely reported to cause mild skin irritation, digestive upset, or allergic-like reactions in sensitive individuals."
Sodium Benzoate (E211): "Caution: In rare cases, may trigger hyperactive behavior, especially when combined with artificial colors. Can form harmful benzene in presence of Vitamin C."
Calcium Propionate (E282): "Caution: Considered safe for most, but some anecdotal reports link it to mild digestive discomfort, headaches, or behavioral changes in children."
BHA (E320): "Caution: Antioxidant preservative. Some debate exists regarding its long-term health effects; often avoided by those seeking 'clean label' products."
BHT (E321): "Caution: Antioxidant preservative with similar debated health concerns to BHA; often avoided by consumers prioritizing natural ingredients."
Nitrates/Nitrites (E249-E252): "Caution: Used in cured meats. Can form nitrosamines when cooked at high temperatures, which are classified as possible carcinogens, a concern at high intake."
Colorings:
Caramel Color (E150a-d): "Caution: While mostly safe, types E150c and E150d may contain 4-MeI, a compound with some debated health concerns in large amounts based on animal studies."
Annatto (E160b): "Caution: Natural coloring; while safe for most, some individuals have reported allergic-like sensitivities such as hives or swelling."
Curcumin (E100): "Caution: Natural yellow spice extract and coloring. Generally safe, but excessive intake could lead to digestive upset or, rarely, allergic reactions."
Titanium Dioxide (E171): "Caution: Used for whiteness. Safety is debated, particularly for nanoparticles; has been categorized as 'possibly carcinogenic to humans' if inhaled. Many consumers avoid it as a precaution."
Allura Red AC (E129): "Caution: Artificial red color strongly linked to hyperactivity and behavioral issues in sensitive children. Widely avoided by concerned parents and those avoiding artificial additives."
Tartrazine (E102): "Caution: Artificial yellow color often linked to hyperactivity and behavioral issues in sensitive children. Some individuals may experience mild allergic reactions like itching."
Sunset Yellow (E110): "Caution: Artificial orange-yellow color commonly linked to hyperactivity and behavioral issues in sensitive children."
Brilliant Blue FCF (E133): "Caution: Artificial blue food coloring. While less frequently linked to hyperactivity, some minor concerns about sensitivities have been reported."
Emulsifiers/Stabilizers/Thickeners:
Lecithin (E322): "Caution: An emulsifier, commonly sourced from soy (be aware if you have a soy allergy) or sunflower. Generally safe, but very rarely reported to cause mild digestive issues."
Mono- and Diglycerides (E471): "Caution: Emulsifiers that can be derived from animal fats (a concern for vegans/vegetarians). Some recent studies debate their potential impact on gut microbiome and inflammation."
Xanthan Gum (E415): "Caution: Thickener and stabilizer. Generally safe, but can cause bloating, gas, or mild digestive upset in sensitive individuals, especially in large amounts."
Guar Gum (E412): "Caution: Thickener and stabilizer. A natural fiber, it can cause digestive upset like gas or bloating, particularly at high consumption levels."
Carrageenan (E407): "Caution: Derived from seaweed; controversial additive. Some animal studies suggest it may contribute to inflammation and digestive issues; avoided by many for these concerns."
Pectin (E440): "Caution: A natural gelling agent from fruits. Generally very safe, but can cause mild digestive discomfort (e.g., bloating, gas) if consumed in very high amounts due to its fiber content."
Polysorbate 80 (E433): "Caution: Emulsifier. Some animal and in-vitro studies suggest a potential link to gut microbiome disruption and inflammation, though human effects are still being debated."
Sweeteners (Artificial/High-Intensity):
Aspartame (E951): "Caution: Artificial sweetener. Controversial for some consumers; individuals with Phenylketonuria (PKU) must strictly avoid due to its phenylalanine content. Some sensitive individuals report headaches or other symptoms."
Sucralose (E955): "Caution: Artificial sweetener. While generally regarded as safe, some studies suggest potential negative effects on gut bacteria and blood sugar regulation in certain individuals."
Saccharin (E954): "Caution: Artificial sweetener. One of the oldest synthetic sweeteners. Historically had cancer concerns (since debunked for humans), but still viewed with caution by some consumers."
Acesulfame Potassium (E950): "Caution: Artificial sweetener. Some animal studies raise questions about its metabolic effects, but it is generally regarded as safe for human consumption at approved levels."
Flavor Enhancers:
Monosodium Glutamate (MSG, E621): "Caution: Flavor enhancer; can trigger a set of symptoms (e.g., headache, flushing, sweating, chest pain) in sensitive individuals, often referred to as 'MSG symptom complex'."
Disodium Guanylate (E626-E629): "Caution: Flavor enhancer, often used with MSG. Those sensitive to MSG may react to these as well, especially if derived from yeast extract."
Disodium Inosinate (E630-E633): "Caution: Flavor enhancer, often used with MSG and Disodium Guanylate. Those sensitive to MSG may also react to this, especially if derived from animal products (for vegans) or yeast extract."
Anti-caking Agents:
Silicon Dioxide (E551): "Caution: Anti-caking agent. Concerns about potential effects mainly apply to nanoparticle forms; generally considered inert in the digestive system, but some choose to avoid for caution."
Calcium Carbonate (E170): "Caution: A common mineral used as an anti-caking agent or whitener. Generally safe, but very high doses can cause mild digestive upset like constipation."
